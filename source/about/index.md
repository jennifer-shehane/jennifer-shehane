Hi, I'm a self-taught front-end developer. After starting my career in web and print design, I found my place in web development where I discovered my passion for test driven development.

I'm a developer at [Cypress.io](https://www.cypress.io).

In my free time, I love going to film festivals, volunteering for local non-profits, entertaining my cat, and learning as much as possible.
